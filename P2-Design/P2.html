	        <h2>5. Navigation Structure</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
	        <p>The navigation structure of Cattius' website can be described as clique,
			meaning it is possible to access all of the pages included in the webpage, 
			from any page of the website. It is possible to access all pages through a navigation bar,
			which is always visible at the top of the page.</p>

	        <p>The reason for choosing the clique structure is to give the user 
			freedom to navigate easily througn the entire website. 
			It also gives the user a clear view of the general structure of the website.
			So if the user is on one subpage they can easily access another subpage within 
			another page by using the navigation bar.</p>

	        	A description of design decisions that are universal to your site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), 
				the color scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page and its appearance, banner, 
				footer, the social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable). In addition to the textual description of 
				these elements, you should include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common elements and no other content. 
				Finally, you should describe how these universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its audience.
