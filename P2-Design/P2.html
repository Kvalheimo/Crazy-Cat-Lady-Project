		<section id="audience">
		    <h2>4. Audience</h2>
		    <p>
		        The users of this website can be categorized into the following:
		    </p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>People who love cats.</li>
		        <li>People who found a homeless cat and do not want it. </li>
		        <li>People want to adopt a cat. </li>
		    </ul>

		</section>
		
		<section id="navigation">
	        <h2>5. Navigation Structure</h2>

	        <p>The navigation structure of Cattius' website can be described as clique, meaning it is possible to access all of the pages included in the webpage, from any page of the website. It is possible to access all pages through a navigation bar, which is always visible at the top of the page.</p>

	        <p>The reason for choosing the clique structure is to give the user freedom to navigate easily througn the entire website. It also gives the user a clear view of the general structure of the website. So if the user is on one subpage they can easily access another subpage within another page by using the navigation bar.</p>
		
		</section>

		<section id="layout">
			<h2>6. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
			<p>The universal design of the website is supposed to be fairy simple and user friendly. This is beacuse the users may have different skills with computers and websties. So both young, adults and elders should be able to use it. For more details about the users, see "Specific Requirements".</p>

			<p>The website Cattius' Cat Castle should focus on accentuating the care that the cats receive at the cat shelter. It should be elegant, while still keeping it clean. The feeling of the website is also cozy and warm, like a cat. < 3 </p>

			<p>
				The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be found below:

				<ul>
					<li>Font: “Flamenco” for the main title (35pt) and navigation bar (20pt), and “Alegreya Sans” for the body (13pt)</li>
					<li>Color Scheme
						<ul>
							<li>Text: Black</li>
							<li>Background: off-white rgb(250, 248, 236)</li>
							<li>Links: orange rgb(243, 138, 121)</li>
							<li>Shadows: pictures of art will be displayed with a gray shadow at on-load, and darker, black shadows when hovered.</li>
							<li>Borders of the tabs: transparency 50% for each of the following colors in order from left to right: rgb(254,171,114), rgb(245, 207,101), rgb(249, 217, 70), rgb(188, 214,237), rgb(176, 171, 216).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Body width: 960px</li>
					<li>Links: The main title “Nan Nan Art Studio” will be a clickable link which will bring users back to the home page. The menu sections will have drop-down menus that can be clicked and contain links to the respective pages.</li>
					<li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included at the top of the page. When the mouse hovers over the tabs within the menu bar, the figurines will appear above the particular tab. When the mouse is on a certain tab, the background of the link will turn to a darker shade of its tab. Hence, the background colors will be, from left to right: rgb(241,121,70), rgb(250, 124,114), rgb(187, 213, 144), rgb(171, 227,237), rgb(166, 141,186).</li>
					<li>Banner: The banner will be "Nan Nan Art Studio" written in Flamenco, as seen at the top of the mock-up picture.</li>
					<li>Footer 1: nanmyanmar@gmail.com | Address</li>
					<li>Background Images: We will use a parchment paper texture provided in Microsoft Office Word, which we will make into a jpeg file.</li>
					<li>Border Images: We will use a tree bark texture also provided on Microsoft Office Word. </li>
					<li>Logo: Our logo will be located on the upper left corner of the page next to the banner and the menu tabs. The word “Atutu” will be surrounded by figurines holding hands, a logo Nan Nan and Jennifer Henbest have requested.</li>
				</ul>
